		<h2>Project <i>Eva Strong</i></h2>

		<p>After years of closed-door pilot runs, in the summer of 2O23, deMITasse Energies is unveiling its first
			technology demonstrator.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p><i>Eva Strong</i> is a 5kW technology demonstrator housed in deMITasse's workshop in New Delhi, and built
				with the sole objective of providing unrestricted access to an operational proof of concept for the
				technologies that we have developed. Although several prototypes have been previously built as paid
				pilots, providing access to third party has usually not been possible. To solve this, deMITasse Energies
				had raised its Pre Series-A in the autumn of 2O22 for a demonstrator that would entirely be built and
				owned by us.</p>

				<p>Second in our continually evolving lineup of technology demonstrators, Eva-X, <i>Eva Strong</i> will
					validate the techno-commercial feasibility of our technology to our potential customers, investors,
					and other stakeholders. At deMITasse we have always believed raising external capital and forging
					partnerships should be done on a bedrock of trust that comes best from a living breathing product.
					To build this trust in our tech, <i>Eva Strong</i> will showcase how all of our innovations
					seamlessly work to store energy and generate power in a way that has not been possible until today.
					Hearing her spool up will also make Vijay's mum very proud!</p>

				<p>Depending on your intent, interest, and role in the deMITasse story, there will be several takeaways
					for you from this demonstration. The key ones that we care about are:</p>

				<ol class="list">
					<li>1. She proves the underlying sciences with operational data and hard numbers.</li>
					<li>2. She proves the maturity of technology and provides clear path to market readiness.</li>
					<li>3. She validates to a reasonable extent, the cost effectiveness of the technology.</li>
					<li>4. She gives you enough reasons to admire the hard-work that deMITasse's tiny but passionate
						team has put in to build something on a shoestring budget that others with $4O million and 5O+
						world class engineers could not in seven years. (...and maybe that's a good reason to invest in
						or partner with us?)</li>
				</ol>

				<p><i>Eva Strong</i> proves and demonstrates lot of things, but it was NOT built to demonstrate lot more
					things. She is a Proof of Concept (PoC) and NOT a prototype. Subsequently, more advanced prototypes
					will be built with investors and stakeholders who believe in our vision (as showcased by <i>Eva
						Strong</i>). Finer parameters like efficiency, performance characteristics, detailed costings,
					effects of scalability etc. will be pursued during iterative development of these prototypes. But
					such prototypes and their data shall be behind closed-doors. Post <i>Eva Strong's</i> successful
					demonstration, we shall also begin taking pre-orders.</p>

				<p>We look forward to having you over for our demo at New Delhi this summer.</p>
